Notes
- You can't see chat
- If stream crashes you have to reopen from the cli
- If you follow over 100 people and they are all live, you will only see 100
- No commercials (streamers don't get revenue.  Only use if you sub or donate in other ways)
- Kappa

Future plans
- Background the livestreamer call
- Live updating streams
